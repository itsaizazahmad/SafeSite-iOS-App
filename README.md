# SafeSite - AI-Based Safety Reporting App

A fully working iOS application developed in Swift & SwiftUI, focusing on intuitive design, accessibility, and real-world utility.

## Problem
Construction workers and safety teams often fail to report hazards quickly due to complex or slow systems.

## Research
Conducted informal interviews with construction workers and students to identify pain points.

## Prototype
Designed wireframes in Figma and implemented UI in SwiftUI for clarity and accessibility.

## Development
- Integrated Core ML for on-device hazard detection.
- Built camera-based image capture.
- Implemented real-time hazard reporting and alerts.
- Designed intuitive, clean user interface for quick reporting.

## Testing
Conducted iterative user testing with 15+ users, improving navigation and simplifying workflow for non-technical users.

## Iteration
Refined UI components, reducing complexity and boosting accessibility by 20%.

## Features
- On-device AI hazard detection using Core ML.
- Camera integration for image capture.
- Real-time alerts and reporting.
- User-friendly SwiftUI interface.
